# Re-Enter-Game-
A 2D action RPG game based on old gameboy games like legend or Zelda frenchies, Breath of Fire series ,etc
# How to run-.
After etracting the file just use any idle to open the file and run it 
...........make sure u have all the necessary files avalabe to run Java files like JDK,JRE,etc
I mostly prefer using Eclips as the IDLE because this whole project is made on it 
I would have provided the .jar file but cuddent run it as an application eather so IDK what to do as i am hard stuck on finding a way to mkae the game as an application file like .exe file
